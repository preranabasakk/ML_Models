## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Predict experimental LogS values using regression techniques
- Visualize predicted vs. experimental values
- Analyze model performance through linear fitting and plotting

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization

---

## 📊 Features

- Scatter plot of predicted vs. experimental values
- Linear regression fitting using `numpy.polyfit`
- Visualization of best-fit regression line
- Configurable figure styles and color palettes
